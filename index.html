                <p>
                    <strong>The Challenge:</strong> Post-pandemic Toronto faces a clash between Return-to-Office mandates and Work-from-Home preferences. Abstract stats about "occupancy rates" often ignore the human cost.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>The Solution:</strong> I created a narrative storyboard following three distinct characters—Amy (the hybrid parent), Raj (the business owner), and Leonard (the relocated worker).

                <p>
                    <strong>The Challenge:</strong> Minard’s famous 1869 map portrays Napoleon’s army as a single "monolith" marching to tragedy. This simplifies the reality that different regiments had vastly different outcomes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>The Insight:</strong> By disaggregating the data into three troops, this comparative redesign reveals that while the central force was decimated, the northern flanking regiments actually returned largely intact.

                <p>
                    <strong>The Context:</strong> With 6 of the top 10 source countries for Canadian immigration now in Asia, diversity is higher than ever. However, integration success varies wildly.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>The Insight:</strong> This visualization highlights a critical gap: Newcomers from Asia (46%) report the highest difficulty making ends meet. The design argues for targeted settlement services.
